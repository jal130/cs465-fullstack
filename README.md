CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

-Architecture-
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

  Express HTML was a method of having the web application live on different pages and each request for different content would return the specified page. In contrast, a SPA only utilizes one page and the requested data is stored in components that can be loaded on the page as requested. 

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  The backend used a NoSQL database because this method allowed the data to be stored in hot storage for quicker access.
  
-Functionality-
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
  JSON is different from Javascript because JSON is a datatype that is returned from API calls. Javascript is a scripting language used to run scripts when a webpage is loaded. JSON ties together the frontend and backend because when the JSON response is returned from the backend database through an API call, the JSON gets interpreted and displayed on the frontend interface.
  
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  We refactored code when we moved the code into their own repositories in order to keep everything modular.
  
-Testing-
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
  Methods are functions that process data in a specified way, endpoints are the address where the data lives and is stored, and security is important so that data is not leaked to people who do not have authorization.
  
-Reflection-
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
  This course helped me see the process of fullstack devleopement as a whole combining the front end and back end components of an application. This gives me a much better grasp of the entire process.
